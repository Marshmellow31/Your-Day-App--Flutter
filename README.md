# Your Day - Flutter Application

A premium, high-performance personal productivity and growth application built with Flutter. "Your Day" features a sophisticated monochrome design system focused on minimizing distractions while maximizing academic and personal output.

## 🌟 Key Features

The application is structured into six core modules, all accessible through a unified navigation system:

1.  **Dashboard**: A sophisticated daily overview featuring a bento-grid layout for "Success Rate," "Tasks Done," and "Daily Streaks."
2.  **Tasks**: A priority-based task management system with search functionality and category filtering (Academic, Research, Personal).
3.  **AI Scheduler**: An intelligent time-blocking utility that optimizes study flows and focus windows based on academic intensity.
4.  **Personal Development**: A "Mastery Index" tracker to visualize growth in specific subjects and core competencies.
5.  **Analytics**: Weekly momentum and persistence tracking via dynamic charts and subject mastery indicators.
6.  **Settings**: Comprehensive account management, privacy controls, and system preferences.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

-   **Monochrome Aesthetic**: A deep black (`#0D0D0D`) and pure white palette designed for high contrast and focus.
-   **Modern Typography**: Utilizes `Manrope` for headings and `Inter` for body text to provide a premium feel.
-   **Modular Components**: Built using a strict design system with reusable `CustomCard`, `StatTile`, and `CommonAppBar` components.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Framework**: Flutter (Material 3 enabled)
-   **Language**: Dart (Null Safety)
-   **Typography**: Google Fonts (Manrope, Inter)
-   **Icons**: Material Symbols & Icons
